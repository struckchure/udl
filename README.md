## Getting Started

To get started with Universal Downloader, follow these steps:

### Installation

    git clone https://github.com/struckchure/udl.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    ```
3.  **Run Directly (for quick testing)**:

    ```
    This command will download and run all necessary Go modules automatically.
4.  **Build and Run (for a standalone executable)**:
    To create a compiled executable, use:
    ```bash
    go build -o udl cmd/main.go
    ```
    You can then run the executable from anywhere in your terminal:

    ./udl
    ```

## Usage

Universal Downloader provides an interactive experience directly in your terminal. Follow the prompts to search, select, and download content.

1.  **Start the Application**:
    Execute the compiled binary or run the `main.go` file:
    ```bash
    ./udl
    # or
    go run cmd/main.go
    ```
2.  **Search for a Series**:
    The application will present an input prompt titled "Search for Series". Type the name of the TV show you want to find (e.g., "tom and jerry") and press `Enter`.
3.  **Select a Series**:
    After your search, a list of matching series will appear. Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys to navigate the list and press `Enter` to select the desired series.
4.  **Select a Season**:
    Once a series is selected, a new list will display all available seasons for that series. Again, use `Up`/`Down` and `Enter` to choose a season.
5.  **Select an Episode**:
    Finally, you will see a list of episodes for the chosen season. Select the episode you wish to download using the arrow keys and pressing `Enter`.
6.  **Download Progress**:
    The application will then initiate the download. A progress bar will appear, showing the download status.
7.  **Download Completion**:
    Upon successful completion, a "Download complete" message will be displayed, indicating the file path where the episode was saved.

*   **Exit at any time**: You can exit the interactive prompts by pressing `Ctrl+C` or `Esc`.
